# Mega Repo for AI Tools classes projects

This repository contains various projects developed for AI Tools classes. Each individual project has its own README file, which includes detailed information and instructions about the specific project.

## Projects:

1. [Chomp](./two-player-game-with-ai/README.md) - two player game that can be played against AI
2. [Smart irrigation system](./smart-irrigation-system/README.md) - irrigation system using Fuzzy Logic
3. [Movies recommendation engine](./03-movie-recommendation/README.md) - Movie recommendation engine based on clustering algorithm
4. [Clustering with Decision Trees and Support Vector Matrix](./04-decision-tree-and-svm-classification/README.md) - Movie recommendation engine based on clustering algorithm
5. [Neural Networks](./05-neural-networks/README.md) - Neural networks applications for classification problems
6. [Computer Vision](./06-computer-vision/README.md) - Gesture-Based Music Control

## How to run

It is recommended to run the code inside a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (`venv`) to isolate the dependencies.

### Steps:

1. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the game
   ```bash
    python chomp.py
    ```
    You can modify the board size by changing the `board_size` argument in the Chomp class initialization in the code.
### Dependencies
All needed dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.
